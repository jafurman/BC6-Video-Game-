# BC6-Video-Game-
Personal Video Game Beta!


 I worked on a small java 2D game that implements game runtime using threads and while loops. The player (BC6 is a robot who that wants to learn about its surroundings). Im still working on the game but I wanted to make the code public. I worked on everything myself and even made 16x16 pixel art in photoshop and imported .wav files for the sound. Bless java libraries for making my life easy. 
 
I loved making this game and I plan on doing much more changes in the future when I have more time (Currently in school).
